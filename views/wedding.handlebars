    <h3>A Note About Altitude</h3>
    <p>
      The town of Steamboat is at an elevation of 6,500 feet and the Four Points Lodge where the ceremony and
      reception will be held is at 9,700 feet. There's less oxygen in the air in Steamboat compared to sea level 
      so you might find you're a little more fatigued than normal or that you're more easily out of breath
      (and if you don't - try hustling up a couple flights of stairs!).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the air being thinner, it is also much drier. Make a concious effort to stay hydrated to
      help prevent any altitude sickness (especially headaches). A good rule of thumb is to take the amount of
      water you'd normally drink every day at sea level and double it. We recommend drinking extra water starting
      several days leading up to your travel to Steamboat as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are very concerned about adjusting to the altitude, there are medications to help prevent altitude sickness.
      You'll need to talk with your doctor to determine if they're right for you.
