    <h2>Ceremony and Reception</h2>
    <p>
      The ceremony will be held at Four Points Lodge - on top of the Steamboat mountain!
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Getting to the Ceremony</h3>
    <p>
      There is parking available at the base of the mountain.
      <a href="https://www.steamboat.com/plan-your-trip/getting-here-and-around/parking-map" target="_blank">Click here</a>
      to see an up-to-date parking map. All guests will need to take the gondola up to the Thunderhead Lodge. From the Thunderhead Lodge,
      there will be shuttles waiting to take you to Four Points Lodge, which is where the ceremony and reception will be held.
      The gondola is free for all wedding guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will have alternate arrangements for those who will not be able to take the gondola.
      You will need to let Dana know by July 1st in order to schedule a shuttle from the base of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Thunderhead Lodge, the shuttles will drop you off right at the wedding venue.  The ceremony site is on the west side of the Four Points Lodge.

    <h3>Monday Morning Brunch</h3>
    <p>
      Dana's parents are hosting a brunch on Monday morning from <span class="heavy">9am - 12pm</span> at their house in Steamboat Springs. It will be a very casual, open-house brunch - you can come by,
      say hello, and leave when you need to. Everyone, children included, are invited to brunch.

    <h3>A Note About Altitude</h3>
    <p>
      The town of Steamboat is at an elevation of 6,700 feet and the Four Points Lodge where the ceremony and
      reception will be held is at 9,700 feet. There's less oxygen in the air in Steamboat compared to sea level
      so you might find you're a little more fatigued than normal or that you're more easily out of breath
      (and if you don't - try hustling up a couple flights of stairs when you get there!).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the air being thinner, it is also much drier. It's critical to stay hydrated to
      help prevent any altitude sickness (especially headaches). A good rule of thumb is to take the amount of
      water you'd normally drink every day at sea level and double it. We recommend drinking extra water starting
      several days leading up to your travel to Steamboat as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are very concerned about adjusting to the altitude, there are medications to help prevent altitude sickness.
      You'll need to talk with your doctor to determine if they're right for you.
